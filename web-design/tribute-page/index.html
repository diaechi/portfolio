        Here's a time line of Bruce Lee's life:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1940</strong> - Born Lee Jun-Fan, San Francisco, 
          California.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1953</strong> - He was introduced to Master 
          Yip Man, a teacher of the Wing Chun style of gung fu.
          For five years Bruce studied diligently and became 
          very proficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1958</strong> - He was also a terrific dancer,
          and in 1958 he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship.
          He studied dancing as assiduously as he did gung fu, 
          keeping a notebook in which he had noted 108 different
          cha cha steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1959</strong> - With $100 in his pocket, 
          Bruce boarded a steamship in the American Presidents
          Line and began his voyage to San Francisco.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1964</strong> - Married Linda Emery,
          one of his students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1965</strong> - He was in a period of
          transition at this time, deciding whether to 
          make acting his career or continue on the path
          of opening nationwide schools of gung fu. His 
          decision was to focus on acting and see if he 
          could turn it into a productive career, which 
          showcased his passion for the martial arts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1967-1971</strong> - Worked hard at 
          furthering his acting career and did get some
          roles in a few TV series and films.

        <li>
          <strong>1970</strong> - When Bruce was getting 
          his strength back from his back injury, he took
          a trip to Hong Kong, producer Raymond Chow 
          contacted Bruce to interest him in doing two 
          films for Golden Harvest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1971</strong> - Bruce moved his family 
          over to Hong Kong. “Fist of Fury,” also called

        <li>
          <strong>1972</strong> - Bruce began filming “The

          Hong Kong-American co-production.
